# Superheroes API

The **Superheroes API** is a RESTful service built using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Flask-Migrate. The API allows you to manage superheroes, their superpowers, and the associations between them. It provides endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and manage superheroes and their powers, alongside relational data between heroes and their powers.

## Project Overview

This API is designed to manage superheroes, their powers, and the relationships between them. The API supports CRUD operations for both superheroes and powers, and it enables linking heroes to specific powers with an associated strength level. The project uses Flask for the web framework and SQLAlchemy as the ORM to manage the database.

---

## Features

- CRUD operations for heroes and powers
- Linking heroes to powers with strength levels (e.g., Strong, Weak, Average)
- Database migration using Flask-Migrate and Alembic
- Automatic serialization of models using SQLAlchemy-Serializer
- Error handling and validation for input data

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.10 or higher
- SQLite (for local development)

---

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MaatiTheDev/challenge-superheroes.git
   cd challenge-superheroes
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   ```

3. **Install dependencies using Pipenv**:
   If you're using `pipenv`, install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pipenv install --dev
   ```

  The `--dev` flag ensures that development packages are also installed
  
---

## Database Migrations

To set up the database, you need to run the migrations from the `server` directory:

1. **Change into the server directory**:

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. **Initialize the database and run migrations**:

   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

This will create the necessary tables in the SQLite database (`app.db`), such as `heroes`, `powers`, and `heroes_powers`.

---

## Seeding the Database

Once the database is set up, you can seed it with initial data using the `seed.py` script:

1. **Run the seed script**:

   ```bash
   python seed.py
   ```

This script populates the database with some initial superhero and power records, allowing you to interact with the API right away.

---

## Running the Application

To run the Flask development server, use the following command from the `server` directory:

```bash
python app.py
```

By default, the server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:5555/`. You can test the API endpoints using Postman, cURL, or a similar tool.

## API Endpoints

Here is a detailed description of each endpoint provided by the API:
